# Floor Lights

Go to [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1541728186) for the Steam version.

## Description
Lights (lamps) that are integrated into the ground. These lamps used to have their power cable hidden underground, but various rim-rodents kept eating them so the cable placement had to be revisited. It is possible to build on top of the floor lights.
